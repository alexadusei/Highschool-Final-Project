# WarioWare: Touched!
For this project, I decided to remake a Nintendo DS game for desktops using Java. This was from many years ago, so the code is atrocious and the game architecture is bad, but I decided it wouldn't hurt to show some interests I had back then. 

# WarioWare: Touched!
The game is WariorWare: Touched! It consists of a series of minigames with a one-worded command you have to complete within a certain amount of time. Succeed and you move on, fail to do so and you lose a life (you originally start with 4). Because the game was designed for the DS, the minigames consist of gestures: swiping, dragging, tapping, etc. You can find more details on the original game and the respective owners on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Touched!">Wikipedia</a>.

This project only contains one character with 6 microgames
