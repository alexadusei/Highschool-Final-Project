# Highschool Final Project
For our final Grade 12 project, we had the option to make a program of our choice. I decided to remake a Nintendo DS game for desktops using Java. The code is atrocious and the architecture is bad, but I decided it wouldn't hurt to show some interests I had back in Grade 12. 

# WarioWare: Touched!
The game was WariorWare: Touched! It consists of a series of minigames with a one-worded command you have to complete within a certain amount of time. Succeed and you move on, fail to do so and you lose lives (you originally start with 4). Because the game was designed for the DS, the minigames consist of gestures: swiping, dragging, tapping, etc. You can find more details on the original game and the respective owners on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare:_Touched!">Wikipedia</a>.

This project only contains one character with 6 microgames
